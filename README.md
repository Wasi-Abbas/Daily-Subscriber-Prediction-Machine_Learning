# Project Title: Daily Subscriber Prediction using Linear Regression

### Description:
In this project, we aim to predict the daily subscriber count for a service or product using linear regression. By analyzing historical data that includes factors such as advertising expenditure, promotional activities, and seasonality, we'll develop a linear regression model to forecast the number of new subscribers on a daily basis.

### Key Components:
Data Collection and Preparation: Historical data containing daily subscriber counts and relevant influencing factors is collected and organized. Features like marketing budget, social media engagement, and external events are identified.

Feature Analysis and Selection: Exploratory data analysis helps identify which features have a strong correlation with daily subscriber counts. Relevant features are selected for the linear regression model.

Model Development: A linear regression model is constructed, taking the selected features as inputs and the daily subscriber count as the target variable. The model aims to establish a linear relationship between the features and the outcome.

Data Splitting: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the linear regression model, while the testing set evaluates its performance on unseen data.

Model Training: The linear regression model is trained on the training dataset to learn the coefficients that best fit the relationship between the features and the target variable.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is tested on the testing dataset. Performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared are calculated to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

Predictions and Insights: The trained model is used to make daily subscriber count predictions based on real-world data. Insights can be drawn about which factors contribute most significantly to subscriber fluctuations.

### Outcome:
By the end of the project, a reliable linear regression model is developed for predicting daily subscriber counts. This model serves as a tool for businesses to estimate subscriber growth, optimize marketing strategies, and make informed decisions about resource allocation.
